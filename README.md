# SirSam_AGameBasedOnUnity
 First attempt to make a game     
I had to say Unity is hard to use. This little game already cost a three whole nights,      
and it still has various bugs. :(

### Some Game Controls
Press:   
A or D to move left or right    
W to glid in the air    
S to drop faster(i dont know why i added this)    
K to hurt yourself(dont know either)     
Space to jump(to be more precise, jumping is more like teleporting the avatar to midair)    
Ctrl or mouse to ATTACK!    

### Problems!!!
pressing space don't always work(maybe because of the logic error in the code?)
